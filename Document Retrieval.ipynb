What is frustrating is that the \"Smart\" app doesn't allow you to print Apple Notes. How can the app not at least work with the basic Apple apps? The Eco tank is nice but all the more reason you don't need an Epson app checking every time whether you have any ink left since this should only happen about once every 6 months to a year. The prints of photos are okay but nothing to write home about.\n",

I have regular new paper, I fan the paper and it still doesn't load.Worst customer service as well. they promised me they will send me a new Epson printer not a refurbished one.Of course they send me a refurbished one and I now have to go through the hassle again of ages of customer service to try to get another new one which they promised me.I had just purchased it in January 2023!!\n",

It jams through the feeder ALL the time!! It also jams through the paper feeder at the bottom! Makes coping and scanning a huge hassle! I purchased this one because it was 'top of the line' and it performs like the bottle of the line. Have purchased 4-5 Epson printers over the last 20 years. Love Epson products but HATE this piece of junk! Highly do NOT recommend.\n",

It’s incredible how hard it must be to make a printer that just prints when it’s told to, because no one can seem to do it. I’ve had this for 3 months and it’s a very high maintenance printer.   \n",

I said my model 3 times and they don't recognize my model number and hang up on you. I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so? I think a piece of tape to hold it together would be better.I will be returning this printer.</td>\n",

       "8297  Very fragile and flimsy printer. I had a simple question for Customer support and it took me an hour to get through. Finally I found out I had to register the product in order to even talk to someone.  When you try to register online they ask you for your product through voice recognition. I said my model 3 times and they don't recognize my model number and hang up on you. I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so? I think a piece of tape to hold it together would be better.I will be returning this printer.   \n",

Fill the paper tray, use about 1/2 the paper in the tray, and bam…. A paper jam!Of course the jam is in the back of printer…. What a pain!!!I do not recommend this printer   \n",
       "1                                   This printer is horrible. it works when it wants to. Simple directions...put paper in under cassette, slide it in, print, Nope it gets stuck and paper does easily fit in. So use the paper tray at the top, nope paper jam everytime, or 30 sheets of paper on it and you get \" please put paper in tray. ended up chucking it   \n",
       "2  If you print something? Paper jams. Reload the paper the only way it can go? Paper jam.WiFi blinks? Paper jam. You leave the printer alone too long? Paper jam. It’s incredible how hard it must be to make a printer that just prints when it’s told to, because no one can seem to do it. I’ve had this for 3 months and it’s a very high maintenance printer.   \n",
